I build, evaluate, and combine (mainly probabilistic) forecasts of the incidence and outcomes of infectious diseases. 

My work is anchored in the goal of understanding and formalizing how forecasts can
be structured and presented to best support adaptive public health policy. A central
component of this goal is to reduce the degree to which forecasting methodology translates
gaps in social or political visibility into public health disparities.

Previously I studied the differential geometry of surfaces immersed in space forms from
the perspective of integrable systems theory and explored information geometry while
transitioning to data science.
